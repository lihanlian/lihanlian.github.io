Inspired by the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics, Lev Pontryagin introduced the Hamiltonian of optimal control and formulated his famous Pontragin's Maximum Principle (PMP). This blog goes through the derivation of Algebraic Riccati Equation from the perspective of control Hamiltonian and using PMP for solving a constrained LQR problem.

## Statement
Let \\((X, L)\\) be a real dynamical system with \\(n\\) degrees of freedom. Here \\(X\\) is the [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space) and \\(L = L(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))\\) the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics), i.e. a smooth real-valued function such that \\(q(t) \in X\\), and \\(\dot{q}(t)\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional "vector of speed". (For those familiar with [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), \\(X\\) is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold), and \\(L : \mathbb{R} \times TX \to \mathbb{R}\\), where \\(TX\\) is the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle) of \\(X\\)).

|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| \\( \frac{\partial L}{\partial z(t_1)} \\) | Gradient of loss with respect to output.                                      | Easy         |
| \\( \frac{dz(t_1)}{d\theta} \\)      | Jacobian of output with respect to params.                                   | Not easy     |
| \\( \lambda(t) \\)                   | Derivative of lambda, a vector, with respect to time.                         | Easy         |
| \\( \lambda(t) \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \\) | vector-Jacobian Product. Can compute with reverse mode autodiff without explicitly constructing Jacobian \\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \\). | Easy         |
| \\( \frac{dz(t)}{d\theta} \\)        | Jacobian of arbitrary layer with respect to params.                           | Not easy     |
| \\( \lambda(t) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \\) | vector-Jacobian Product. Can compute with reverse mode autodiff without explicitly constructing Jacobian \\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \\). | Easy         |

So we see that (10) requires calculating \\( \frac{dz(t)}{d\theta} \\) at the very last point in time \\( t_1 \\) (output layer) and possibly any general point in time \\( t \\) (arbitrary hidden layer). That is exactly what we're trying to avoid!

Can we get rid of \\( \frac{dz(t)}{d\theta} \\) from (10) by making a judicious choice of \\( \lambda(t) \\)? 🧐 -->
