Inspired by the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics, Lev Pontryagin introduced the [_Control Hamiltonian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(control_theory)) and formulated his celebrated [_Pontragin's Maximum Principle (PMP)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin%27s_maximum_principle). This blog will first discuss general cases of optimal control problems, including scenarios with both free final time and final states. Then, the derivation of [_Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_Riccati_equation) in the context of **_Continuous Linear Qudratic Regulator (LQR)_** from the perspective of the **_Control Hamiltonian_** will be introduced. It will then explain the **_PMP_**, finally followed by the example problem of **_Constrained Continous LQR_**.

## More general senarios of optimal control problems

Consider the following simple robot dynamics (single-integrator model) and the objetive functional aimed to minimize:

$$ J = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} (x^2 + u^2) \, dt $$

$$ s.t. \dot{x} = u(t)$$

This is also in [one of the previous blogs](https://lihanlian.github.io/posts/2024/06/30) on Euler-Lagrange Equation, and it's the second example but is a fixed final state and fixed final time problem (\\(x(0) = 0, x(1) = 10,\\)). In this blog, Let's take a look at more general cases including free final state and/or free final time. However, before directly solves the problem, I want to shows the process of derivation common solution strategries for different secaniros using calculus of variations.

## Continuous LQR and ARE

It turns out that the Algebraic Riccati Equation can be derived using PMP.

$$ J = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{T} (x(t)'Qx(t) + u(t)'Ru(t)) \, dt $$
 
$$ s.t. \dot{x} = Ax(t) + Bu(t) $$

### - Formulate Control Hamiltonian:

$$ H(x, u, \lambda, t) = \frac{1}{2} (x'Qx + u'Ru) + \lambda' (Ax + Bu) $$

### - Construsct co-state Equations:

$$ \dot{\lambda} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} $$

$$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = Qx + A'\lambda $$

$$ \dot{\lambda} = -Qx - A'\lambda $$

### - Obtaining Optimal \\( u \\):

Since we are __NOT__ concerned with the control input constraints here, the optimal control input \\(u\\) can be directly obtained by setting the paritial derivatives to be zero.

$$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial u} = Ru + B'\lambda = 0, \quad  u = -R^{-1}B'\lambda$$

### - Substitute optimal \\( u \\) into state space equation:

$$ \dot{x} = Ax + B(-R^{-1}B'\lambda) = Ax - BR^{-1}B'\lambda $$

### - Riccati Equation:

Suppose \\( \lambda = Px \\), then \\( \dot{\lambda} = \dot{P}x + Px \\), substitute into co-state equation: 

$$ \dot{\lambda} = \dot{P}x + P(Ax - BR^{-1}B'Px) = -Qx - A'Px $$

$$ \dot{P}x + PAx - PBR^{-1}B'Px = -Qx - A'Px $$

$$ \dot{P} + PA + A'P - PBR^{-1}B'P + Q = 0 $$

So we see that (10) requires calculating \\( \frac{dz(t)}{d\theta} \\) at the very last point in time \\( t_1 \\) (output layer) and possibly any general point in time \\( t \\) (arbitrary hidden layer). That is exactly what we're trying to avoid!

Can we get rid of \\( \frac{dz(t)}{d\theta} \\) from (10) by making a judicious choice of \\( \lambda(t) \\)? 🧐 -->
