[**_Neural style transfer (NST)_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_style_transfer) is a valuable learning tool for anyone interested in deep learning, encompassing essential components such as [**_convolutional neural networks (CNNs)_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), VGG network, upsampling and [**_residual networks_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network). The basic neural style transfer method captures and manipulates image features using CNNs and the VGG network directly on the input image. In contrast, the fast neural style transfer method uses dataset to train an inference neural network that can be used for real-time style transfer. This blogs contains the explanation for the implementation of both methods. Corresponding repository can be found [here (Github)](https://github.com/lihanlian/basic-and-fast-neural-style-transfer).
