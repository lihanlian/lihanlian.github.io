Euler-Lagrange equations plays an important role in trajectory optimization, and it is also a critical stepping stone for many powerful optimal control techniques like Pontrygain's Maximum Principle. It is als0 very useful in cases like deriving the equation of motion. In this blog, derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equation and two simple cases of its application are introduced

## Euler-Lagrange Equation

## Statement

Let \\((X, L)\\) be a real dynamical system with \\(n\\) degrees of freedom. Here \\(X\\) is the [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space) and \\(L = L(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))\\) the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics), i.e. a smooth real-valued function such that \\(q(t) \in X\\), and \\(\dot{q}(t)\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional "vector of speed". (For those familiar with [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), \\(X\\) is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold), and \\(L : \mathbb{R} \times TX \to \mathbb{R}\\), where \\(TX\\) is the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle) of \\(X\\)).

Let \\(\mathcal{P}(a, b, x_a, x_b)\\) be the set of smooth paths \\(q : [a, b] \to X\\) for which \\(q(a) = x_a\\) and \\(q(b) = x_b\\).

The action functional \\(\mathcal{S} : \mathcal{P}(a, b, x_a, x_b) \to \mathbb{R}\\) is defined via

\\[
\mathcal{S}[q] = \int_{a}^{b} L(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) \, dt.
\\]

A path \\(q \in \mathcal{P}(a, b, x_a, x_b)\\) is a stationary point of \\(\mathcal{S}\\) if and only if

\\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i}(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) = 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, n.
\\]

Here, \\(\dot{q}(t)\\) is the time derivative of \\(q(t)\\). When we say stationary point, we mean a stationary point of \\(\mathcal{S}\\) with respect to any small perturbation in \\(q\\). See proofs below for more rigorous detail.
