Euler-Lagrange equation plays an essential role in trajectory optimization, serving as a critical stepping stone for many powerful optimal control techniques, such as Pontrygain's Maximum Principle. Beyond its applications in deriving equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equation provides a foundational understanding of Lagrange multipliers and its usage in adjoint sensitivity analysis, which is vital neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODES). In this blog, derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equation and two simple cases of its application are introduced.

## Euler-Lagrange Equation

Let \\((X, L)\\) be a real dynamical system with \\(n\\) degrees of freedom. Here \\(X\\) is the [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space) and \\(L = L(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))\\) the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics), i.e. a smooth real-valued function such that \\(q(t) \in X\\), and \\(\dot{q}(t)\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional "vector of speed". (For those familiar with [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), \\(X\\) is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold), and \\(L : \mathbb{R} \times TX \to \mathbb{R}\\), where \\(TX\\) is the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle) of \\(X\\)).

## Statement

Let \\(\mathcal{P}(a, b, x_a, x_b)\\) be the set of smooth paths \\(q : [a, b] \to X\\) for which \\(q(a) = x_a\\) and \\(q(b) = x_b\\).

The action functional \\(\mathcal{S} : \mathcal{P}(a, b, x_a, x_b) \to \mathbb{R}\\) is defined via

\\[
\mathcal{S}[q] = \int_{a}^{b} L(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) \, dt.
\\]

A path \\(q \in \mathcal{P}(a, b, x_a, x_b)\\) is a stationary point of \\(\mathcal{S}\\) if and only if

\\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i}(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) = 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, n.
\\]

Here, \\(\dot{q}(t)\\) is the time derivative of \\(q(t)\\). When we say stationary point, we mean a stationary point of \\(\mathcal{S}\\) with respect to any small perturbation in \\(q\\). See proofs below for more rigorous detail.
