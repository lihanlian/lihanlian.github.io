This blog provides an in-depth exploration of [_Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_dynamic_programming) and the **_Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR)_**, two powerful algorithms used in optimal control. We begin with a discussion on the fundamental principles underlying these algorithms, including **_INewton's method_**, **_Bellman's Equation_**, and the concept of **_contraction mapping_**. Following this theoretical foundation, we delve into the specifics of the DDP and iLQR algorithms, illustrating their application through the challenging problem of double pendulum swing-up control.
