Algthough optimal control and reinforcement learning appears to be quite different from eacho other, it turns out they are actually closely related. [_Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_dynamic_programming) and the **_Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR)_**, two powerful algorithms used in optimal control, are great examples on how model-base reinforcement learning can be related. This blog begins with a discussion on the fundamental principles, including **_Newton's method_** and **_Bellman's Equation_**. Later it delves into the specifics of the DDP and iLQR algorithms, illustrating their application through the challenging problem of double pendulum swing-up control.
